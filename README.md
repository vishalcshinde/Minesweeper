# Minesweeper Game
##PC/UVa IDs: 110102/10189

Have you ever played Minesweeper? This cute little game comes with a certain operating
system whose name we can’t remember. The goal of the game is to find where
all the mines are located within a M × N field.
The game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are
adjacent to that square. Each square has at most eight adjacent squares. The 4×4 field
on the left contains two mines, each represented by a “*” character. If we represent the
same field by the hint numbers described above, we end up with the field on the right:

```
*...          *100
....          2210    
.*..          1*10
....          1110 
```

##Input
Number of rows and columns

##Output
a grid would be created with '.' and random mines would be placed with '*' as shown above on the left
then a logic runs and tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square as shown above on the right.
